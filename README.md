# Penpot Plugins

## What can you find here?

We've been working in an MVP to allow users to develop their own plugins and use the existing ones.

There are 2 important folders to keep an eye on: `apps` and `libs`.

In the `libs` folder you'll find:

- plugins-runtime: here you'll find the code that initializes the plugin and sets a few listeners to know when the penpot page/file/selection changes.
  It has its own [README](libs/plugins-runtime/README.md).
- plugins-styles: basic css library with penpot styles in case you need help for styling your plugins.

In the `apps` folder you'll find some examples that use the libraries mentioned above.

- contrast-plugin: to run this example check <a href="#create-a-plugin-from-scratch-or-run-the-examples-from-the-apps-folder">Create a plugin from scratch</a>

- example-styles: to run this example you should run

```
npm run start:styles-example
```

Open in your browser: `http://localhost:4202/`

## Run Penpot sample plugins

This guide will help you launch a Penpot plugin from the penpot-plugins repository. Before proceeding, ensure that you have Penpot running locally by following the [setup instructions](https://help.penpot.app/technical-guide/developer/devenv/).

In the terminal, navigate to the **penpot-plugins** repository and run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
Then, run `npm start` to launch the plugins wrapper.

After installing the dependencies, choose a plugin to launch. You can either run one of the provided examples or create your own (see "Creating a plugin from scratch" below).
To launch a plugin, Open a new terminal tab and run the appropriate startup script for the chosen plugin.

For instance, to launch the Contrast plugin, use the following command:

```
// for the contrast plugin
npm run start:plugin:contrast
```

Finally, open in your browser the specific port. In this specific example would be `http://localhost:4302`

A table listing the available plugins and their corresponding startup commands is provided below.
